Description: Computes the effective range of a smoothing matrix, 
    which is a measure of the distance to which smoothing occurs. 
    This is motivated by the application of spatial splines for adjusting 
    for unmeasured spatial confounding in regression models, but the
    calculation of effective range can be applied to smoothing 
    matrices in other contexts. For algorithmic details, see Rainey and Keller
